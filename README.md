# The QueryDuck Project

## Project description

The purpose of this project is to provide a standardized, generic platform for expressing, retrieving and exchanging semantically meaningful digital information.

It came into existence as a result of my never-ending desire to label and classify things both physical and digital in the most generally useful way possible. I've evaluated many systems and solutions for this but all of them turned out to suffer from various combinations of being too domain-specific, too complicated, too closed/proprietary or otherwise suffering from some fatal flaw within the context of my use cases.

If you want to know more about the philosophical and/or structural background of the project, please read the documentation in the `docs` directory.


## Repositories

The code is currently split into the following repositories:

- [queryduck](https://github.com/arjenmeek/queryduck), which you are viewing now. This contains the generic Python modules which are used by the server & clients
- [queryduck-cli](https://github.com/arjenmeek/queryduck-cli), the CLI client application
- [queryduck-server](https://github.com/arjenmeek/queryduck-server), the server application
- queryduck-web (not yet published at this time), a webbrowser-based client written in JavaScript


## Status and roadmap

The project is still in pre-alpha phase. The code is still changing a lot, and being able to easily deploy the software is not yet a concern. Don't expect to be able to use it.

For now, don't expect to be able to use any of this, but feel free to have a look around.

My goal is for this to eventually become a system others can deploy and use for managing arbitrary semantically structured information.


## Explanation of the name

QueryDuck: It performs queries (among other things), and I like ducks. Simple as that.
