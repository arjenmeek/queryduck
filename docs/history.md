# CrunchyVicar: Project history

This document is an attempt to provide some basic historic context for the project.


## 2010-2014: First ideas

After having tried to find solutions suitable for storing various types of information relevant to my day-to-day life in a generic and re-usable way, but not succeeding, I started to become convinced that I should try to build something myself.

Initially this process suffered from a rather heavy case of 'scope creep', but after a lot of time spent on smaller experiments, giving the ideas some time to mature, and researching into existing approaches such as RDF, the core idea started to stabilize (admittedly still with a rather large scope).


## 2014-2015: Project start, initial documentation

With a general idea of the desired structure for the project, I started to make attempts to document the ideas in my head and create a source control repository to put documents and code in. This also meant I needed a name, which unfortunately I'm useless at, so after some playing around with random wordlists I ended up with *CrunchyVicar*.


## 2015-2017 (now): Proof of Concept 1

The first code that followed directly from the mostly-stable ideas behind the project was written, starting with a Python-based server application.


## 2015-2017 (now): Expanding documentation

Documentation is a work in progress, and probably will be for the foreseeable future. The aim is for documentation to develop along with PoC implementations so that the reasons for specific implementation design choices are clear.
