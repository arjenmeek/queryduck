# CrunchyVicar: Project history

This document is an attempt to provide some basic historic context for the project.


## 2010-2014: First ideas

After having tried to find solutions suitable for storing various types of information relevant to my day-to-day life in a generic and re-usable way, but not succeeding, I started to become convinced that I should try to build something myself.

Initially this process suffered from a rather heavy case of 'scope creep', but after a lot of time spent on smaller experiments, giving the ideas some time to mature, and researching into existing approaches such as RDF, the core idea started to stabilize (admittedly still with a rather large scope).


## 2014-2015: Project start, initial documentation

With a general idea of the desired structure for the project, I started to make attempts to document the ideas in my head and create a source control repository to put documents and code in. This also meant I needed a name, which unfortunately I'm useless at, so after some playing around with random wordlists I ended up with *CrunchyVicar*.


## 2015-2019: Proof of Concept 1.0

The first code that followed directly from the mostly-stable ideas behind the project was written, starting with a Python-based server application.


## 2019-2020 (now): Proof of Concept 1.1

Through various major changes, the original structure and functionality of PoC 1.0 was almost entirely removed.

In 2020 in particular, development has picked up speed due to me spending more time on it. As of April, the combination of server, cliclient and common library have reached a point where I've been able to apply it to real-world use cases.

The code quality and completeness is still very much of a pre-alpha level, but it's approaching a point where I might want to publish it for others to have a look at.
