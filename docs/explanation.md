# Introduction

Welcome to the CrunchyVicar project. This project's goal is to establish a technical standard for expressing and exchanging digital information that is structured in a semantically meaningful way.

This document is meant to serve as a general introduction to the project that is easier to read but less thorough than the [design document](design.md).


## What does "semantically meaningful" mean?

Digital information only has a meaning when it is processed within a certain context. For example, a particular bunch of bytes might be interpreted as a picture, or as a page of text.

In such cases, the information is primarily meaningful to humans, who may look at the picture or read the text. For a computer program to attach meaning to this kind of information, it first has to attempt to process it.

Within this context, *semantically meaningful* refers to information that is structured in such a way that it is directly meaningful (without additional processing) to computer programs.



# TODO

There's no more text. Yet. Stay tuned?
